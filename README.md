Hello Wonderful Friends Viewing my Profile!

My name is Daniel Cho. I am currently grinding through bootcamp material in order to learn programming. This is me getting sidetracked from that work after studying all day. Currently, several labs that I have done for Flatiron aren't showing up on my GitHub, and that makes me sad. :( Anyways, I'm a student at Virginia Tech majoring in BIT (Business Information Technology) and I am going to graduate in Spring 2021. I'm starting my Senior year soon. In my free time, I like to play League of Legends, Minecraft, and other games. The coronavirus has not changed my lifestyle at all. I'm still glued to my computer for many hours a day.

Anyways, thanks for reading to the end fellow friends!
